I'm a 15yr old highschool student. `ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°` âœ¨ https://tnixc.space âœ¨

~ I'm interested in frontend development and UI/UX.

~ Looking into javascript frameworks and how they work(a lot to be done here)

~ Also using Java for some other stuff(but I'm really bad at it)

~ I'm curious about a lot of things, and a fan of [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin)

_I can't put javascript there because I don't think I ever used it to do anything, still got lots to learn_
