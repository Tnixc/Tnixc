I'm a 15yr old highschool student.  `ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°`  @tnixc on discord

I have a website at https://tnixc.space. I write blog posts there sometimes.

- I'm interested in frontend development, open source, and UI/UX, math. I find a lot of stuff interesting. I also spend my time drawing.
- Mainly working with typescript and frontend adjacent stuff, but now more with rust and cli tools.
- Also using Java for some other stuff(but I'm really bad at it).
- Also work on theming, particularly [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) and [tokyo](https://github.com/tnixc/tokyo).

### Stuff I somewhat know(always learning):
```json
{
  "Languages": ["Typescript/Javascript", "Python", "HTML/CSS", "Go", "Rust"],
  "Frameworks": ["Vue/Nuxt", "Tailwind", "Astro", "Svelte"],
  "Tools": ["Git", "Figma", "Blender"]
}
```
