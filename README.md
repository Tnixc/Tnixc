I'm a 15yr old highschool student. `🇨🇦 🇭🇰` @tnixc on discord

I have a website at https://tnixc.space. I write blog posts there sometimes.

- I'm interested in frontend development, open source, and UI/UX, math. I find a lot of stuff interesting.
- Mainly working with typescript and frontend adjacent stuff, but now more with rust and cli tools.
- Also using Java for some other stuff(but I'm really bad at it).
- Also work on theming, particularly [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) and [tokyo](https://github.com/tnixc/tokyo).

### Stuff I somewhat know(always learning):

```rust
Languages → "Typescript/Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS"
Frameworks → "Vue/Nuxt, Tailwind, Astro"
Tools → "Git, Figma"
Learning → "Rust, Svelte, Go, SQL"
```
